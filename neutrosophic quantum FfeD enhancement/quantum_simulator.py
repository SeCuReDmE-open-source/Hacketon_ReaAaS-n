Neutrosophic Quantum FfeD Enhancement - Quantum Simulator Module

This module is an enhanced version of the original FfeD quantum simulator module, incorporating neutrosophic linear and vector/matrix operations to handle missing variables and improve the accuracy and robustness of the FfeD framework.

When a system has missing variables, the neutrosophic linear approach is used to enhance the growth rate for the fractal and the anti-entropy calculations. The variables are exchanged into one of the three variables of the neutrosophic logic: truth (T), indeterminacy (I), and falsity (F). This approach allows the system to handle uncertainty and indeterminacy more effectively.

The following variables are considered in the system:
- Mass
- Momentum
- Energy
- Charge
- Spin
- Cubic dimension
- Golden ratio
- Hypotenuse length
- Angles
- Work
- Heat
- Force
- Velocity
- Position
- Time
- Permittivity
- Permeability
- Electric field
- Magnetic field
- Wave amplitude
- Wavevector
- Angular frequency
- Propagation velocity
- Number of corners
- Transitional state

These variables are then exchanged into one of the three variables of the neutrosophic logic: truth (T), indeterminacy (I), and falsity (F). The choice of the variable depends on its importance in the system. If the variable is crucial and its value is needed, it is assigned to T. If the importance of the variable is uncertain, it is assigned to I. If the variable is not important, it is assigned to F.

The neutrosophic linear approach enhances the growth rate for the fractal and the anti-entropy calculations using the following equations:
- Fractal Growth Rate with Neutrosophic Logic:
  G(t) = k * Df * μ * V * T + I * F
- Anti-Entropy Rate with Neutrosophic Logic:
  A(t) = ∫0^t G(t) dt - λ * S(t) * T + I * F

The neutrosophic linear equations are translated into a computational algorithm using appropriate programming languages and tools.
