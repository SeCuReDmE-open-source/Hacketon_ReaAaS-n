# ReaAaS-n : AI Algorithm Builder

## Overview

Welcome to ReaAaSn, a powerful platform designed to **transform natural language descriptions into functional algorithms**. Our innovative approach allows users to articulate their algorithmic needs in plain language, and Hacketon provides the underlying structure and tools to bring those ideas to life. This project provides a **complete development environment** leveraging containerization for consistency and ease of use.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   Git
*   Docker
*   Docker Compose

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd FfeD_project
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    *   For Linux/macOS:
        ```bash
        ./install.sh
        ```
    *   For Windows:
        ```bash
        install.bat
        ```
    This step will handle the necessary software requirements for the project [1].

3.  **Start the services:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```
    This command will start all the necessary components defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file, creating an isolated environment for Hacketon to run [2].

## Building the Project

The project utilizes a **Makefile** to streamline common development tasks [3].

*   **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    make install
    ```
    This command installs the project's dependencies, including Python libraries [3, 4].
*   **Build Docker Images:**
    ```bash
    make build
    ```
    This command builds the necessary Docker images for the project's services [3, 4].
*   **Run Services:**
    ```bash
    make run
    ```
    This command starts all the project's services, likely using the Docker containers built in the previous step [3-5].
*   **Run Tests:**
    ```bash
    make test
    ```
    This command executes the project's tests to ensure functionality [3, 4].
*   **Clean Up:**
    ```bash
    make clean
    ```
    This command removes build artifacts, allowing for a fresh build [3, 4].

## Using Hacketon

Hacketon is designed with a **modular architecture**, allowing for the creation and integration of various algorithm-building components [6]. Detailed documentation for individual modules, including examples and usage instructions, can be found in the **`docs/modules.md`** file [6].

### Example Interaction

While the specifics of each algorithm-building module are detailed in the documentation, here's a general example of how you might interact with a module:

1.  Prepare your input data as required by the specific module (e.g., in a `.csv` file as `data/input.csv`) [4].
2.  Run the relevant script for the module using a command like:
    ```bash
    python src/modules/<ModuleName>/<script_name>.py
    ```
    For example:
    ```bash
    python src/modules/YourAlgorithmModule/process_data.py
    ```
3.  The module will process your input and save the output to a designated location (e.g., `data/output.csv`) [4].

Modules within Hacketon incorporate **error handling and logging mechanisms** to ensure smooth operation and aid in debugging [4]. If any issues arise during execution, they will be logged for analysis [4].

## Building for Production

When preparing Hacketon for a production environment:

1.  **Update the version** in the `modulesettings.json` file [7].
2.  **Package the module** by running the script `./SDK/Scripts/create_packages.sh` [7].

## Testing

Hacketon incorporates various testing approaches to ensure the reliability of its components [4, 6].

*   Automated tests can be run using the `make test` command [3, 4].
*   The repository includes a **Continuous Integration (CI)** configuration (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) for automated testing and deployment whenever changes are made to the repository [6].
