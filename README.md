make test
```

To clean up, run:
```bash
make clean
```

### Example Usage

Here is an example of how to use the NeutrosophicDataProcessing module:

1. Prepare your input data in CSV format and save it as `data/input.csv`.
2. Run the data filter adapter script:
```bash
python src/modules/NeutrosophicDataProcessing/data_filter_adapter.py
```
3. The filtered data will be saved as `data/output.csv`.

### Error Handling and Logging

The `data_filter_adapter.py` script includes error handling and logging mechanisms to ensure smooth execution and easy debugging. If any errors occur during the execution, they will be logged for further analysis.

### Continuous Integration (CI)

The repository includes a CI configuration file `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for automated testing and deployment. The CI pipeline will automatically build, test, and deploy the project whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

### Documentation

Detailed documentation for individual modules and their functions can be found in the `docs/modules.md` file. The documentation includes examples and usage instructions for each module.

### Neutrosophic Quantum FfeD Enhancement Setup Instructions

To set up the Neutrosophic Quantum FfeD Enhancement module, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd FfeD_project
```

2. Add the current repository as a submodule:
```bash
git submodule add <URL-of-the-current-repo> neutrosophic-quantum-ffed-enhancement
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

3. Install dependencies for the Neutrosophic Quantum FfeD Enhancement module:
```bash
make install_neutrosophic
```

4. Build the Docker image for the Neutrosophic Quantum FfeD Enhancement module:
```bash
make build_neutrosophic
```

5. Run the Docker container for the Neutrosophic Quantum FfeD Enhancement module:
```bash
make run_neutrosophic
```

6. Access the Neutrosophic Quantum FfeD Enhancement service at [http://localhost:8084](http://localhost:8084)

### Setting Up and Running the Airbyte Pipeline

To set up and run the Airbyte pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that Airbyte is installed and running. You can use Docker to set up Airbyte by following the instructions on the Airbyte documentation.

2. Configure Airbyte to connect to the PostgreSQL database. This can be done by setting up a new source in Airbyte with the PostgreSQL connector. Provide the necessary connection details such as host, port, database name, username, and password.

3. Set up a destination in Airbyte to connect to the PostgreSQL database. This will allow Airbyte to write data to the database.

4. Create a connection in Airbyte between the source and the destination. This will enable data to flow from the source to the destination.

5. Ensure that the `docker-compose.yml` file includes the necessary services for Airbyte, PostgreSQL, and any other required components. The `database` service in the `docker-compose.yml` file already includes the PostgreSQL configuration.

6. Start the Airbyte data ingestion pipeline by running the `docker-compose up` command. This will start all the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file, including Airbyte and PostgreSQL.

7. Run the primary polyglot script to activate the DevOps NeuUuR-o pipeline and connect Airbyte to PostgreSQL and MindsDB:
```bash
python src/modules/NeutrosophicDataProcessing/airbyte_pipeline.py
```

By following these steps, you can configure Airbyte to connect to the pipeline and start ingesting data into the PostgreSQL database. For more detailed instructions, refer to the Airbyte documentation.

### Modular Architecture for Polyglot Needs

The repository now includes a modular architecture that allows for easy integration and extension of different components for each of the five polyglot needs. The polyglot needs include:

1. **Programming languages**: The project uses multiple programming languages, including Python and JavaScript.
2. **Data formats**: The project handles various data formats, such as CSV, JSON, and XML.
3. **Integration with external services**: The project integrates with several external services, such as MindsDB, Airbyte, and DevOps pipelines.
4. **Libraries and tools**: The project uses various libraries and tools for data processing, machine learning, and mathematical operations.
5. **Modular architecture**: The project is designed with a modular architecture, allowing for easy integration and extension of different components.

### Data Processing Logic for Polyglot Needs

The repository now includes data processing logic for each polyglot need, involving reading data from different sources, applying transformations, and writing the processed data to the desired output format. The data processing logic is implemented in various modules and scripts, such as:

- `neutrosophic quantum FfeD enhancement/core.py`
- `neutrosophic quantum FfeD enhancement/grid_optimizer.py`
- `src/modules/NeutrosophicDataProcessing/airbyte_pipeline.py`
- `neutrosophic quantum FfeD enhancement/mindsdb_integration.py`
- `src/modules/NeutrosophicDataProcessing/data_filter_adapter.py`

### Integration with External Services

The repository now ensures that the logic can interact with external services, such as databases, APIs, and machine learning models, using appropriate libraries and tools for each polyglot need. The integration with external services is demonstrated in various modules and scripts, such as:

- `neutrosophic quantum FfeD enhancement/core.py`
- `neutrosophic quantum FfeD enhancement/grid_optimizer.py`
- `src/modules/NeutrosophicDataProcessing/airbyte_pipeline.py`
- `neutrosophic quantum FfeD enhancement/mindsdb_integration.py`
- `src/modules/NeutrosophicDataProcessing/data_filter_adapter.py`

### Testing Procedures

The repository now includes thorough testing of the implemented logic to ensure it meets the requirements and works correctly. The testing procedures include unit tests, integration tests, and manual testing. The testing procedures are updated to include new unit tests for the implemented logic.

To run the tests, use the following command:
```bash
make test
```
