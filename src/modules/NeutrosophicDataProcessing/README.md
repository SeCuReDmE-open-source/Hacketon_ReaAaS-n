# Neutrosophic Data Processing Platform

## Overview

Neutrosophic Data Processing Platform is an advanced AI-driven system designed to handle complex data analysis and processing tasks. Leveraging Docker for containerization, MindsDB for machine learning, and a suite of custom modules, this platform provides a robust environment for developers and data scientists to build, train, and deploy intelligent applications.

## Features

- **Scalable Architecture**: Utilize Docker Compose to manage and orchestrate multiple services seamlessly.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Integrates with MindsDB to provide powerful predictive analytics.
- **Neutrosophic Logic**: Implements neutrosophic linear and set operations to handle uncertainty and indeterminacy in data.
- **Extensible Modules**: Easily add or remove modules to customize the platform to your needs.
- **GPU Support**: Enable GPU acceleration for enhanced performance in data processing tasks.

## Services

- **ffed_server**: Core server handling API requests and managing modules.
- **mindsdb**: Machine learning service powered by MindsDB for predictive analytics.
- **database**: PostgreSQL database for data storage and management.
- **redis**: In-memory data store for caching and real-time data processing.
- **test**: Testing environment for running automated tests.
- **neuuro_actuator**: Actuator service for processing data with GPU support.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed on your system. [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- **Docker Compose**: Included with Docker Desktop or install separately. [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
